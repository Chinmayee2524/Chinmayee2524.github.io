  Head over to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [create a new public repository](https://github.com/new) named _username_.github.io, where _username_ is your username (or organization name) on GitHub.

  If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.
